// Crash diagnostics, so one test round is enough: a vectored exception handler that logs the first few
// access violations (what was accessed, where, the stack as module+offset) and writes the first two as
// SDWet-crash-<n>.dmp next to the .asi (tools\dump.ps1 reads them). It only observes: exceptions go on
// to whoever handles them (the game's handlers, SEH guards). Only installed with logging on.
